### User Stories
* As a new DIY-er, I want an easily accessible database of interesting projects, so that can immediately find what I am looking to build.
* As an experienced DIY-er, perhaps older, I want to be able to share my extensive knowledge with someone who might not have been exposed to my type of creations.
* As a casual weekend DIY-er, I want to be inspired by the top ranking projects that others with my interest have already ‚Äòliked‚Äô or tried.
* As an experienced social media user, I want to see the familiar social media setup of scrolling through other user‚Äôs DIY‚Äôs.
